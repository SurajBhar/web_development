            This is a sample paragraphs from the cs50 course week 8  lecture on HTML, CSS and Javascript.
            If you're doing some mental math now, you might recognize those numbers. 
            Any time you're counting from 0 to 255, you're using 8 bits, or 1 byte, 
            which is to say that an IP address, as represented here with these hash symbols, 
            is 32 bits in total, or 4 bytes.
        </p>
        <p>
            So your mind can immediately start to wander 
            if you do some of that mental math to conclude that, oh, it would seem that 
            you can have no more than, per past discussions, 4 billion IP addresses, 
            because 2 to the 32nd power gives us four billion, especially 
            if we don't have to worry about negative numbers, which is to imply that 
            there can only be 4 billion devices on the internet in total.
